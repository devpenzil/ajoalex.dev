        ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I&nbsp;m a front-end developer and a 12th-grade student. My
        primary focus this year is on achieving academic excellence, as a
        result, I&nbsp;ve temporarily stepped back from socials and launching
        new projects, although I continue to maintain my existing side projects
        with great care.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-[180%] mt-5">
        {" "}
        However, I remain excited to expanding my network. Feel free to reach
        out via email or schedule a call if you would like to connect or simply
        have a friendly chat.{" "}
      </p>{" "}

        I&nbsp;m very curious about AI, open source, internet startups, Saas,
        developer tools and beautiful UX! Drop me a msg via email if you&nbsp;d
        like to hear my thoughts on what you&nbsp;re working on.
